EverywhereDense
===============

"Everywhere Dense is a novel generated by the principle of recursive acronym expansion, in which this sentence is repeatedly interpolated with random words."

The Haskell code takes this sentence and expands it repeatedly by
replacing a word - "dense", say - with a sequence of words beginning
with those letters - "don't even swap everywhere", for example.

This procedure is repeated five times to give the text's structure
(sentence, paragraph, chapter, section).

The words are chosen randomly from a list of words which are loosely
themed on the principles used to generate the text, and also chosen so
that all letters in the alphabet get recycled.
