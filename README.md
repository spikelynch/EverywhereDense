===============

Basic idea: a generative text build by progressive expansion. A simple
idea would be an automatically generated palindrome which starts with
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and then inserts balanced pairs so
that the palindrome grows indefinitely. This has been done, however,
and I want the nature of the text (whatever that means) to be apparent
on reading a small sample. A 50,000+ word Panama palindrome, when
sampled at any point, would look like a list of weird items.

Some ideas

* A text made of words which can be sectioned into new words. For
  example: "plan type" can produce "plan ant type" or "into new" can
  produce "into ton new"

* Elaboration of this: a single block of characters which can be
  divided into words in many (many, many) different ways
