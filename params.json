{"name":"Everywhere Dense","tagline":"A generated novel for NaNoGenMo '14 ","body":"Everywhere Dense\r\n================\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere Dense is a novel generated by the principle of recursive acronym expansion, in which this sentence is repeatedly interpolated with random words.\"\r\n\r\nThe Haskell code takes this sentence and expands it repeatedly by\r\nreplacing a word - \"dense\", say - with a sequence of words beginning\r\nwith those letters - \"don't even swap everywhere\", for example.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is repeated five times to give the text's structure\r\n(sentence, paragraph, chapter, section).\r\n\r\nThe words are chosen randomly from a list of words which are loosely\r\nthemed on the principles used to generate the text, and also chosen so\r\nthat all letters in the alphabet get recycled.\r\n\r\nOne possible version of [Everywhere Dense](https://github.com/spikelynch/EverywhereDense/blob/master/everywhere.dense.pdf?raw=true)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
